Measured full pytest: **200 passed / 0 skipped / 0 deselected / 0 failed / 0 errors**. Alembic head: **0007_phase1g**.
Schema assertions: Phase 1B **16/16**, 1C **20/20**, 1D **15/15**, 1E **22/22**, 1F **29/29**, 1G **58/58 PASS**.
Executable architecture checks: **108/108 PASS**; Phase 1A runtime assertions: **25/25 PASS**. Phase 1A–1F regressions: **PASS**.

Evidence: [verified remote identity](evidence/phase1g/implementation-ci/verified_identity.json), [measured remote summary](evidence/phase1g/implementation-ci/empirical_summary.json), [local complete gate log](evidence/phase1g/local-final/ci_complete.log).
This implementation CI is distinct from the subsequent documentation-only closure head. The formal closure CI and issuance identities are recorded in [Phase1H_entry_decision.md](Phase1H_entry_decision.md) only after that head passes complete CI; this document does not authorize Phase 1H coding.

## Actual contracts

`domain/retrieval.py` defines frozen extra-forbid contracts for KnowledgeRetrievalQuery/Policy, RetrievalRun/SearchPlan/Candidate, lexical/vector/hybrid/rerank/scope-validation results, EvidencePackItem/Pack, sufficiency policy/result, trusted source policy/rule, external candidates/validation/runtime records, fallback guidance, RAGContextPack, trace/statistics, Wiki/Graph and KnowledgeRuntimeReadinessResult.

Queries are bounded to 4,000 characters, policy candidate limits/top-k are bounded, non-finite scores are rejected, vector weight requires a registry config, configured cross-language requires policy languages, and external enabling requires a trusted policy. Each evidence item has exactly one complete internal canonical chain or one runtime external chain. T4 sources cannot enter evidence. Redirect URLs must be credential-free HTTPS.

Application ports isolate lexical/vector/rerank/planner/discovery/Wiki generation and repositories. Domain/application do not import SQLAlchemy, pgvector, provider SDKs, graph SDKs or LangGraph. Similarity and model suggestions cannot produce formal legal decisions.

PASS: `test_policy_and_evidence_contracts_prevent_unbounded_or_unverified_sources` / domain validation assertions in `test_phase1g_algorithms.py`; all 16 deterministic algorithm cases pass, including 4 credential/redirect cases. Schema constraints provide a second enforcement layer for exact evidence chains, derived flags and review/readiness status.

## Boundaries / exclusions / regression status

Phase 1E formal Context remains the only context input. Phase 1F PostgreSQL Source/Document/Version/Structure/Chunk/Binding/EvidenceReference/Citation tables remain canonical Knowledge Source of Truth. Retrieval stores, runtime materialization state, indexes, Wiki/Graph and RAGContextPack are derived. Runtime external evidence remains VERIFIED, separate from ACTIVE canonical knowledge.

Excluded: production model/provider execution, LLM answers, formal classification, regulation applicability, country-specific compliance routing, risk, Candidate/Final Compliance Path, required regulatory-document decisions and production legal agents. External parsing currently accepts attributed canonical JSON through the existing controlled MIME boundary; HTML/PDF web crawling and unrestricted discovery are outside this foundation. Embedding/rerank tests use explicit deterministic adapters behind ports. Original source text is preserved; no reviewed translation becomes original official text.

Phase 1A–1F regressions pass under the current 0007 migration. Earlier migration files 0001–0006 are unchanged. The historical Phase 1F main baseline remains `fe4e1bb8b0002aa9b4c68106bea5ebc0898fed95`; its 142-test baseline is historical and is not substituted for this Phase 1G 200-test result.
