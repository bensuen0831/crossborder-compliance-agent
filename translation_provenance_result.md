Above values are independently verified through GitHub Checks measured evidence for the identified CI run; they do not reuse Phase 1E totals. The local full gate at `4e7d0d9759c42b2da91a23dea47f2cdea0243449` is separate corroborating evidence. The linked remote manifest pins the immutable pre-issuance baseline. Later governance commits contain documentation/evidence only and retain the tested implementation.

Known exclusions: Phase 1G retrieval/ranking/reranking/RAG/answer generation, classification, regulation applicability, country rules, risk and compliance paths are excluded. Ingestion currently supports approved canonical structure JSON upload or controlled HTTPS JSON sources; automatic legal PDF/DOCX import, external site crawling, actual model-provider execution and affected-project impact calculation are excluded. Storage/embedding tests use explicit adapters; PostgreSQL and Redis are real. Whitespace token counting is a deterministic foundation measure, not provider tokenizer equivalence. Local PostgreSQL 17.11/Redis 8.0.2 are separately identified from CI PostgreSQL 16/Redis 7.

Authoritative boundary: PostgreSQL canonical knowledge tables; Phase 1C source definitions/collections/bindings and model metadata are reused; Phase 1B RegulatoryStructureNode/EvidenceReference/Citation and durable admin review are reused. Object storage retains original artifacts. Registry, FTS and pgvector are derived projections/indexes. Formal Phase 1E context is the only context input.

KnowledgeTranslation stores original-version identity, source/target language, artifact reference, method, optional Phase 1C model deployment reference, provenance, review actor/status and version. Original chunks are never overwritten. AI method requires a registry model configuration; translation execution itself is excluded.

Submissions enter PENDING and cannot supply a fabricated approved reviewer. Independent human review is required. Reviewed AI/HUMAN translations remain identified as translations; only approved OFFICIAL method is eligible for official_evidence. Approval does not fabricate original-source status for AI content.

PASS assertions: AI pending is not official; self approval fails; independent approval succeeds while AI remains nonofficial; reviewed OFFICIAL distinction; original chunk text unchanged; unreviewed official assertion rejected and rolled back.
