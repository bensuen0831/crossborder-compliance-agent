Evidence: [verified remote identity](evidence/phase1g/implementation-ci/verified_identity.json), [measured remote summary](evidence/phase1g/implementation-ci/empirical_summary.json), [local complete gate log](evidence/phase1g/local-final/ci_complete.log).
This implementation CI is distinct from the subsequent documentation-only closure head. The formal closure CI and issuance identities are recorded in [Phase1H_entry_decision.md](Phase1H_entry_decision.md) only after that head passes complete CI; this document does not authorize Phase 1H coding.

## Source chains and atomicity

Internal items retain Document → Version → StructureNode → Chunk → Citation → EvidenceReference → Source/official URL, plus language/date/content hash, source authority/tier/jurisdiction specificity, score provenance, selected index, policy and analysis snapshot.

Runtime external items instead retain the VERIFIED runtime record → immutable original bytes/hash → parsed artifact version/node locator → existing EvidenceReference/Citation → approved Source/URL/authority/tier/date/retrieval time and all policy versions. Canonical IDs are nullable only for this explicit external branch; DB exact-chain CHECK prevents parallel or mixed chains.

Pack, items, sufficiency result and context pack finalize atomically with the run. `test_pack_commit_fk_failure_rolls_back_without_parallel_result` forces a real PostgreSQL FK commit failure: no pack/item remains and the audited run is FAILED. Idempotency rejects changed payloads and other actors. Stored results are revalidated before return.

EvidencePack and RAGContextPack are derived, never LegalBasis or Knowledge SoT. Their manifest freezes index/embedding record IDs and external artifact identities; the signed snapshot external record is reused without refetching a changed website.

## Boundaries / exclusions / regression status

Phase 1E formal Context remains the only context input. Phase 1F PostgreSQL Source/Document/Version/Structure/Chunk/Binding/EvidenceReference/Citation tables remain canonical Knowledge Source of Truth. Retrieval stores, runtime materialization state, indexes, Wiki/Graph and RAGContextPack are derived. Runtime external evidence remains VERIFIED, separate from ACTIVE canonical knowledge.

Excluded: production model/provider execution, LLM answers, formal classification, regulation applicability, country-specific compliance routing, risk, Candidate/Final Compliance Path, required regulatory-document decisions and production legal agents. External parsing currently accepts attributed canonical JSON through the existing controlled MIME boundary; HTML/PDF web crawling and unrestricted discovery are outside this foundation. Embedding/rerank tests use explicit deterministic adapters behind ports. Original source text is preserved; no reviewed translation becomes original official text.

Phase 1A–1F regressions pass under the current 0007 migration. Earlier migration files 0001–0006 are unchanged. The historical Phase 1F main baseline remains `fe4e1bb8b0002aa9b4c68106bea5ebc0898fed95`; its 142-test baseline is historical and is not substituted for this Phase 1G 200-test result.
